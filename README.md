Case paths bring the power and ergonomics of key paths to enums.

## Motivation

Swift endows every struct and class property with a [key path][key-path-docs].

``` swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  var name: String
}

\User.id    // KeyPath<User, Int>
\User.name  // WritableKeyPath<User, String>
```

This is compiler-generated code that can be used to abstractly zoom in on part of a structure,
inspect and even change it, all while propagating those changes to the structure's whole. They are
the silent partner of many modern Swift APIs powered by
[dynamic member lookup][dynamic-member-lookup-proposal], like SwiftUI
[bindings][binding-dynamic-member-lookup-docs], but also make more direct appearances, like in the
SwiftUI [environment][environment-property-wrapper-docs].

Unfortunately, no such structure exists for enum cases!

``` swift
enum UserAction {
  case home(HomeAction)
  case settings(SettingsAction)
}

\UserAction.settings  // ðŸ›‘
```

And so it's impossible to write generic code that can zoom in on and propagate changes to a
particular case.

## Introducing: case paths

This library intends to bridge this gap by introducing what we call "case paths."

Case paths can be enabled for an enum using the `@CasePathable` macro:

```swift
@CasePathable
enum UserAction {
  case home(HomeAction)
  case settings(SettingsAction)
}
```

And case paths can be produced from a "case-pathable" enum using the `#casePath` macro:

```swift
#casePath(\UserAction.home)      // Case<UserAction, HomeAction>
#casePath(\UserAction.settings)  // Case<UserAction, SettingsAction>
```

### Case paths vs. key paths

While key paths package up the functionality of getting and setting a value on a root structure,
case paths package up the functionality of extracting and embedding a value on a root enumeration.

``` swift
user[keyPath: \.name] += ", Jr."
user[keyPath: \.name]  // "Blob, Jr."

let action = #casePath(\UserAction.home).embed(.onAppear)
#casePath(\.home).extract(from: action)  // Optional(HomeAction.onAppear)
```

Case path extraction can fail and return `nil` because the cases may not match up.

``` swift
#casePath(\.settings).extract(from: action)  // nil
````

Case paths, like key paths, compose. Where key paths use dot-syntax to dive deeper into a structure,
case paths use optional-chaining:

``` swift
\HighScore.user.name
// WritableKeyPath<HighScore, String>

#casePath(\UserAction.home?.timeline)
// Case<UserAction, TimelineAction>
```

Case paths, also like key paths, provide an
"[identity](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0227-identity-keypath.md)"
path, which is useful for interacting with APIs that use key paths and case paths but you want to
work with entire structure.

``` swift
\User.self                   // WritableKeyPath<User, User>
#casePath(\UserAction.self)  // Case<UserAction, UserAction>
```

## Other libraries

  * [`EnumKit`](https://github.com/gringoireDM/EnumKit) is a protocol-oriented, reflection-based
    solution to ergonomic enum access and inspired the creation of this library.
